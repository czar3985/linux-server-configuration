# Linux Server Configuration

The project takes a baseline installation of a Linux server
and prepares it to host web applications. A database server is 
installed and configured, security measures againsts a number of 
attack vectors are implemented and a previously coded web application
is deployed in it to make it publicly accessible.

This README walks the user through the steps of configuring and accessing the 
Linux web server.
